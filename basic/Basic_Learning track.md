# Learning Track for Beginners: Building ML APIs with Python, FastAPI, and scikit-learn

I've created a simplified 7-step learning track for beginners to develop an ML model API. Each step introduces fundamental concepts gradually while working toward a complete solution.

See [Fast API - First step](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/).

## Overview of the Learning Track

## Step 1: Introduction to FastAPI Basics

- Context: First exposure to APIs and FastAPI framework
- Tasks: Set up environment, create a simple "Hello World" API
- Learning Outcomes: Understanding API concepts and FastAPI basics

## Step 2: Working with Data and Basic ML Concepts

- Context: Introduction to data handling and ML fundamentals
- Tasks: Load dataset, explore data, create a simple ML model
- Learning Outcomes: Basic data manipulation and ML model training

## Step 3: Integrating ML Models with FastAPI

- Context: Combining ML models with API endpoints
- Tasks: Create prediction endpoint with pre-trained model
- Learning Outcomes: Using ML models within API endpoints

## Step 4: Model Persistence and Project Structure

- Context: Saving/loading models and organizing code
- Tasks: Implement model persistence, structure the project properly
- Learning Outcomes: Model management and project organization

## Step 5: Input Validation and Error Handling

- Context: Making APIs robust and user-friendly
- Tasks: Add input validation, implement basic error handling
- Learning Outcomes: Creating resilient APIs with proper feedback

## Step 6: Basic Documentation and Testing

- Context: Documenting and testing API functionality
- Tasks: Enhance API documentation, write simple tests
- Learning Outcomes: Documentation best practices and basic testing

## Step 7: Simple Deployment and Next Steps

- Context: Making the API accessible to others
- Tasks: Configure for deployment, implement basic monitoring
- Learning Outcomes: Basic deployment concepts and monitoring
