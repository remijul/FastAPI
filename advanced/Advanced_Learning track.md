# AI Model API Development Learning Track

This is progressive learning track for developing ML model APIs using Python, FastAPI, and scikit-learn. This track consists of 5 steps, each building on the previous one to develop a complete ML model API.

# Step 1: Authentication and Authorization

## Context and Objectives

- Implement API authentication with JWT tokens  
- Set up user management and different access levels  

## Tasks

- Create user management with password hashing  
- Implement JWT-based authentication  
- Set up role-based authorization (admin vs. regular users)  

# Step 2: API Security Best Practices (OWASP Top 10)

## Context and Objectives

- Implement security best practices according to OWASP API Security Top 10  
- Add request validation and input sanitization  
- Implement proper error handling and logging  
- Set up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies  

## Tasks

- Add input validation with Pydantic schemas  
- Implement proper error handling with custom exception handlers  
- Set up logging for security events and API access  
- Configure CORS policies to restrict API access  
- Implement request throttling and API keys for improved security  

# Step 3: Advanced API Features and Monitoring

## Context and Objectives

- Implement advanced API features for model monitoring  
- Add prometheus metrics for API performance tracking  
- Set up background tasks for model updates and maintenance  
- Implement API usage analytics  

## Tasks

- Add prometheus metrics endpoints  
- Implement model performance monitoring  
- Create background tasks for periodic model evaluation  
- Set up API usage analytics tracking  
- Implement alerting for model drift and performance issues  

# Step 4: API Testing and Version Control

## Context and Objectives

- Implement comprehensive testing for the API  
- Learn to use version control for API development  
- Deploy the API in a controlled environment  
- Validate API functionality with test suites  

## Tasks

- Set up a proper versioning system for the API  
- Create unit tests for all API endpoints  
- Implement integration tests for the entire API  
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing  
- Document the testing and versioning approach  

# Step 5: Comprehensive Documentation and Accessibility

## Context and Objectives

- Create comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI standards  
- Ensure the API and its documentation are accessible  
- Implement automated documentation generation  
- Make the documentation available to stakeholders in accessible formats  

## Tasks

- Enhance the API with OpenAPI documentation  
- Create interactive API documentation with examples  
- Generate accessibility-compliant documentation  
- Implement a documentation portal for stakeholders  
- Create documentation for installation, testing and maintenance
